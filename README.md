# Project Objectives
## Data Management: 
Create a structured Excel database to efficiently record and organize key information about road accidents, including date, location, causes, and outcomes.
## Analysis and Reporting: 
Utilize Excel's analytical tools to generate insights and visualize trends in accident data, facilitating informed decision-making and identifying critical areas for intervention.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/belix2228/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20project.xlsx">Road Accident Dataset</a>

## Data Collection
Sources: Gather data from traffic reports, police records, insurance claims, or official databases. You might find datasets online from government or safety organizations.
Variables to Include:
Date and time of the accident
Location (Latitude and longitude, or specific intersections)
Types of vehicles involved
Weather conditions
Severity (minor, moderate, severe)
Causes (distraction, speeding, weather)
Injuries and fatalities
